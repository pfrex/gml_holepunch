# gml_holepunch

First commit of an untested hole punch implementation in GameMaker Studio 2. 
To test you would need to run the server on a machine publicly reachable over the WAN with ports 3005 and 4510 open, or else edited to your desired ports. 
The client project would need to be given the url of the publicly available server and the corresponding ports. When running the clients, they would need to be on separate private networks to demonstrate that holepunching was succesful.
